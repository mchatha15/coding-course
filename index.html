<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2>Welcome to my site!</h2>

<div id="flex-div">
  <p class="white">I am currently learning to code with Code First Girls. Going over everything from how the
  internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
  Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...</p>

  <ol>
    <li class="orange">HTML is cool</li>
    <li class="purple">CSS is cooler</li>
    <li class="orange">JS is the best</li>
  </ol>

What do you need to create a website?

<ul>
  <li>Not much!</li>
  <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
  <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
  <li>A web browser (I am using chrome)</li>
  <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
</ul>
